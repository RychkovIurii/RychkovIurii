### Hi there!

#### Varia Vantaa graduate. Hive Helsinki student (Ã‰cole 42 curriculum).

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a dedicated learner exploring the intersections of programming, data analysis, and software development.

My current GitHub commit rankings in Finland, according to [committers.top](https://committers.top/finland):

[![committers.top badge](https://user-badge.committers.top/finland/RychkovIurii.svg)](https://user-badge.committers.top/finland/RychkovIurii)

*Latest joke:  
I scored 5.0/5.0 at Varia, yet my espresso machine still returns `HTTP 418: I'm a teapot` when I ask for coffee.*
